# Our chosen website generation tool Hugo (genuflect) does not recognise
# symlinks (at least it follows them sometimes) and so hugo server --watch
# does not update when README.md is changed. But we can't have the symlink
# going the other way, because that complicates working with the repository
# on GitHub (genuflect).  So touch a file we don't care about, tricking
# stupid Hugo.
