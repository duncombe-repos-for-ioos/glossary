A glossary of IOOS terms.

IOOS is a veritable alphabet soup of acronyms and terms that are like-yet-not-like normal language, in another word, jargon. 
This is an attempt to make some sense of it for a relative newcomer. Some (most?) of these terms are in [IOOS Acronym List](http://www.ioos.noaa.gov/about/acronym_list.html).
